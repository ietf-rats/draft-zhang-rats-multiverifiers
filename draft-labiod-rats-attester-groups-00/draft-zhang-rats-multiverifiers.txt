          Handling Multiple Verifiers in the RATS Architecture
                 draft-zhang-rats-multiverifiers-latest

Abstract

   In the IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture, a
   Verifier accepts Evidence and generates Attestation Results needed by
   Relying Parties.  This document provides a solution to inconsistent
   behaviors of the Verifier in the RATS architecture by introducing a
   mechanism to aggregate Attestation Results collected from multiple
   Verifiers at the Relying Party while simplifying its policy and
   operation.

1.  Introduction

   The Remote Attestation procedures (RATS) Architecture illustrates an
   overview of the roles and data-flows between them in Section 3 of
   [RFC9334].  Section 5 of [RFC9334] refines the data-flow diagram by
   describing two reference models: Passport Model and Background- check
   Model.  As discussed in that document, a Verifier accepts Evidence
   from Attesters, appraises it using Appraisal Policy, and generates
   Attestation Results needed by Relying Parties.

   As a single Verifier can introduce a single point of failure, either
   as the target of a denial of service attack, due to compromization,
   service congestion, or broken Internet connectivity to the Verifier,
   relying on a single trusted entity can introduce significant risk.

   The architectural pattern of using multiple Verifiers are one
   approach to counter such risks.  Nevertheless, it is not guaranteed
   that different Verifiers generate the same Attestation Results.  Some
   exemplary reasons include: a) RATS conceptual messages, such as
   Reference Values, Endorsements, Appraisal Policy for Evidence for
   different Verifiers, are not necessarily aligned, b) certain
   Verifiers can be compromised, or c) some Verifiers follow different
   Appraisal Policy for Evidence.  This lack of alignment can result in
   significant issues in both Passport Model and Background-check Model,
   which is detailed as follows.  The Solution to address the problem of
   the lack of alignment is detailed in Section 3.

1.1.  Passport Model Cases

   Under the Passport Model, an Attester sends Evidence to a Verifier.
   The Verifier generates the Attestation Results and sends these back
   to the Attester.  The Attester conveys the Attestation Results to the
   Relying Party to proof its trustworthiness.  Fig. 1 and 2 show
   scenarios that multiple heterogeneous Verifiers can introduce issues
   in a Passport Model based system.

   In Fig. 1, if Verifier A is not trusted by the Relying Party,
   Attestation Results sent by the Attester can always be rejected by
   the Relying Party, which means that the Attester may end up in a loop
   of producing and conveying Attestation Evidence and wait for
   Attestation Results in vain, repeatedly.

   In Fig. 2, Verifier A generates positive Attestation Results for an
   Attester, while Verifier B generates negative Attestation Results for
   the same Attester.  To trick a Relying Party into putting unjustified
   trust in the Attester, an Attester can act maliciously by selectively
   forwarding only Attestation Results from Verifier A and not Verifier
   B.  Such malicious behavior would render a trustworthiness assessment
   of Attesters by the Relying Party biased or unreliable.

2.  Two

3.  Three

   RFC 3161 [RFC3161] provides a method to timestamp a message digest to
   prove that it was created before a given time.

   This document defines two new CBOR Object Signing and Encryption
   (COSE) [STD96] header parameters that carry the TimestampToken (TST)
   output of RFC 3161, thus allowing existing and widely deployed trust
   infrastructure to be used with COSE structures used for signing
   (COSE_Sign and COSE_Sign1).

3.1.   Use Cases

   This section discusses two use cases, each representing one of the
   two modes of use defined in Section 4.

   A first use case is a digital document signed alongside a trustworthy
   timestamp.  This is a common case in legal contracts.  In such
   scenario, the document signer wants to reinforce the claim that the
   document existed on a specific date.  To achieve this, the document
   signer acquires a fresh TST for the document from a TSA, combines it
   with the document, and then signs the bundle.  Later on, a relying
   party consuming the signed bundle can be certain that the document
   existed _at least_ at the time specified by the TSA.  The relying
   party does not have to trust the signer's clock, which may have been
   maliciously altered or simply inaccurate.

   This usage scenario motivates the "Timestamp then COSE" mode defined
   in Section 4.1.

   A second use case is the notarization of a signed document by
   registering it at a Transparency Service.  This is common for
   accountability and auditability of issued documents.  Once a document
   is registered at a Transparency Service's append-only log, its log
   entry cannot be changed.  In certain cases, the registration policy
   of a Transparency Service may add a trustworthy timestamp to the
   signed document.  This is done to lock the signature to a specific
   point in time.  To achieve this, the Transparency Service acquires a
   TST from a TSA, bundles it alongside the signed document, and then
   registers it.  A relying party that wants to ascertain the
   authenticity of the document after the signing key has been
   compromised, can do so by making sure that no revocation information
   has been made public before the time asserted in the TST.

   This usage scenario motivates the "COSE then Timestamp" mode
   described in Section 4.2.

3.2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Modes of Use

   There are two different modes of composing COSE protection and
   timestamping, motivated by the usage scenarios discussed above.

   The diagrams in this section illustrate the processing flow of the
   specified modes.  For simplicity, only the COSE_Sign1 processing is
   shown.  Similar diagrams for COSE_Sign can be derived by allowing
   multiple private-key boxes and replacing the label [signature] with
   [signatures].

4.1.  Timestamp then COSE (TTC)

   shows the case where a datum is first digested and submitted to a TSA
   to be timestamped.

   This mode is utilized when the signature should also be performed
   over the timestamp to provide an immutable timestamp.

   A signed COSE message is then built as follows:

   *  The obtained timestamp token is added to the protected headers,

   *  The original datum becomes the payload of the signed COSE message.

   The message imprint sent to the TSA (Section 2.4 of [RFC3161]) MUST
   be the hash of the payload field of the COSE signed object.

4.2.  COSE then Timestamp (CTT)

   shows the case where the signature(s) field of the signed COSE object
   is digested and submitted to a TSA to be timestamped.  The obtained
   timestamp token is then added back as an unprotected header into the
   same COSE object.

   This mode is utilized when a record of the timing of the signature
   operation is desired.

   In this context, timestamp tokens are similar to a countersignature
   made by the TSA.

5.  RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Tokens COSE Header Parameters

   The two modes described in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 use different
   inputs into the timestamping machinery, and consequently create
   different kinds of binding between COSE and TST.  To clearly separate
   their semantics two different COSE header parameters are defined as
   described in the following subsections.

5.1.  3161-ttc

   The 3161-ttc COSE _protected_ header parameter MUST be used for the
   mode described in Section 4.1.

   The 3161-ttc protected header parameter contains a DER-encoded
   RFC3161 TimeStampToken wrapped in a CBOR byte string (Major type 2).

   To minimize dependencies, the hash algorithm used for signing the
   COSE message SHOULD be the same as the algorithm used in the RFC3161
   MessageImprint.

5.2.  3161-ctt

   The 3161-ctt COSE _unprotected_ header parameter MUST be used for the
   mode described in Section 4.2.

   The message imprint sent in the request to the TSA MUST be either:

   *  the hash of the signature field of the COSE_Sign1 message.

   *  the hash of the signatures field of the COSE_Sign message.

   In either case, to minimize dependencies, the hash algorithm SHOULD
   be the same as the algorithm used for signing the COSE message.  This
   may not be possible if the timestamp token has been obtained outside
   the processing context in which the COSE object is assembled.

   The 3161-ctt unprotected header parameter contains a DER-encoded
   RFC3161 TimeStampToken wrapped in a CBOR byte string (Major type 2).

6.  Timestamp Processing

   RFC 3161 timestamp tokens use CMS as signature envelope format.
   [STD70] provides the details about signature verification, and
   [RFC3161] provides the details specific to timestamp token
   validation.  The payload of the signed timestamp token is the TSTInfo
   structure defined in [RFC3161], which contains the message imprint
   that was sent to the TSA.  The hash algorithm is contained in the
   message imprint structure, together with the hash itself.

   As part of the signature verification, the receiver MUST make sure
   that the message imprint in the embedded timestamp token matches a
   hash of either the payload, signature, or signature fields, depending
   on the mode of use and type of COSE structure.

   Appendix B of [RFC3161] provides an example that illustrates how
   timestamp tokens can be used to verify signatures of a timestamped
   message when utilizing X.509 certificates.

7.  Security Considerations

   Please review the Security Considerations section in [RFC3161]; these
   considerations apply to this document as well.

   Also review the Security Considerations section in [STD96]; these
   considerations apply to this document as well, especially the need
   for implementations to protect private key material.

   The following scenario assumes an attacker can manipulate the clocks
   on the COSE signer and its relying parties, but not the TSA.  It is
   also assumed that the TSA is a trusted third party, so the attacker
   cannot impersonate the TSA and create valid timestamp tokens.  In
   such a setting, any tampering with the COSE signer's clock does not
   have an impact because, once the timestamp is obtained from the TSA,
   it becomes the only reliable source of time.  However, in both CTT
   and TTC mode, a denial of service can occur if the attacker can
   adjust the relying party's clock so that the CMS validation fails.
   This could disrupt the timestamp validation.

   In CTT mode, an attacker could manipulate the unprotected header by
   removing or replacing the timestamp.  To avoid that, the signed COSE
   object should be integrity protected during transit and at rest.

   In TTC mode, the TSA is given an opaque identifier (a cryptographic
   hash value) for the payload.  While this means that the content of
   the payload is not directly revealed, to prevent comparison with
   known payloads or disclosure of identical payloads being used over
   time, the payload would need to be armored, e.g., with a nonce that
   is shared with the recipient of the header parameter but not the TSA.
   Such a mechanism can be employed inside the ones described in this
   specification, but is out of scope for this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the COSE header parameters defined in
   Table 1 to the "COSE Header Parameters" registry
   [IANA.cose_header-parameters].
